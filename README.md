## Introduction

See the challenge [here](https://ischool.syr.edu/landing-pages/civic-data-hackathon-syracuse-roads-challenge).


## [Dynamic version](http://ist-deacuna-s1.syr.edu:8080/) or [Static version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/daniel-acuna/hackathon_syracuse/master/src/Civic_Data_Challenge.html)

I am building a predictive model of road conditions. Using data from 10 years ago does much better than using only
the types of roads and another non-temporal features. Quite interesting.

A dynamic version of the system was built using [R Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/)
